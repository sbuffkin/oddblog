My dream journal. I endeavored to update this rather often as I dream rather often.

If you'd like to read my thoughts on dream journaling, well just [look here](/blog/why_dream.html). 

These are all dated according to when I actually had the dream, so it's probably worth looking around in here. I mostly post things from my archives after polishing it up a little.
That said, I only ever edit for grammar and phrasing, I only ever include details I actually remember from the dreams.
