My sketchbook, or at least selections from various ones from the past years.

I draw all kinds of stuff, still endeavoring to get better but I think i've found at least a vein to strike at in the past few years. I'm not great at self-commentary on my art, so a lot is presented with little to no comment, but maybe I'll try and muse on some of it in the future.
