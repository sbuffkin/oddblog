Just a bunch of stuff that crossed my mind at some point, I make no claims to any of it being correct or not stupid. 
Some of merit may eventually be turned into essays of their own if I ever get around to it.
<!-- excerpt -->

* Once, years ago, an uncle of mine who works in a casino, he told me something. It only just now struck me how deeply ironic it was:
"The stock market is a fuckin ripoff."

* most bugs probably die of hypothermia

* places may have more interesting lives than people do. If it is the right spot. A shelter in the woods contains multitudes of stories. Though perhaps places are more limited in the variety of stories they can tell compared to humans. They are stuck with their form.

* shouldnt a down escalator have a different name? deescalator.

* if there are four legged animals, why not four armed animals? A monkey perhaps? Geckos? Whats the real differentiator between arms and legs?

* When brain in jar immortality is invented, the poors are allowed in as well! They get to be integrated into menial labor machines, forever. You wanna live forever? Sure! As a bus!

* bad guys in stories trying to destroy the world really just dont want to commit suicide alone

* "Spring is stupid, it just oscillates rapidly between winter weather and summer weather, one day is 30, the next is 90."
   "Oscillates rapidly eh...
    Like a...spring?"

* Its bad luck to walk under a ladder cause its naturally unstable and youre putting yourself at risk. I'd bet most other "bad lucks" are likely similar in some fashion.

* Music is the primordial art form. It existed even before language did, long before humanity itself walked upon the earth.

* There's something to being reduced to a byline in someone else's life someday. "an old friend got me into this, i don't talk to him anymore."

* most "natural games" are animals playing around within simple physics interactions. Usually some emulation of hunting. Games are really broadly subdivided into "abstract logic" and "physics". These days we fall far too much on the creation of abstract logic toys since our artificial world revolves around such mechanisms too much. There is a lack of physics based virtual play, in the sense of there being some level of chaos and skill-honing.

* saw a stand selling t shirts emblazoned with hi resolution pictures of cameras, I wonder which camera took the photos of the others. Was it all in a big circle

* The classical yuppie sees everyone as fundamentally interchangeable units. This is what they call fitting in. Anyone is (or rather, is demanded to be) as good as anyone else in a core sense, so the only thing that actually matters is the trappings. What you wear, where you eat, what you drink, what you own. More or less the thesis statement of the bateman style yuppie. Economic fluidity, people as commodity.

* a hit and run, twisted into a pretzel in the grill of an utz truck

* The Bible represents an absolute testament to the power of word over the human soul. Art above all else shapes reality. Its power cannot be discounted. Books, and only books, control all of humanity. We all pledge fealty to books. Feel free to exchange "The Bible" with your bible of choice.

* heard a passing conversation, "im rarin', but its not go time yet, so Im not rarin' to go. Just rarin'." The turn-knob dial of rarin'-ness. Nil-Rarin-RarinToGo-Go!!!

* if we truly are part of the eternal return, at least there is an infinity tying me to you.
