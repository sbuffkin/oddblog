Just a bunch of stuff that crossed my mind at some point, I make no claims to any of it being correct or not stupid. 
Some of merit may eventually be turned into essays of their own if I ever get around to it.
<!-- excerpt -->

* Once, years ago, an uncle of mine who works in a casino, he told me something. It only just now struck me how deeply ironic it was:
"The stock market is a fuckin ripoff."

* most bugs probably die of hypothermia

* places may have more interesting lives than people do. If it is the right spot. A shelter in the woods contains multitudes of stories. Though perhaps places are more limited in the variety of stories they can tell compared to humans. They are stuck with their form.

* shouldnt a down escalator have a different name? deescalator.

* if there are four legged animals, why not four armed animals? A monkey perhaps? Geckos? Whats the real differentiator between arms and legs?

* bad guys in stories trying to destroy the world really just dont want to commit suicide alone

* Its bad luck to walk under a ladder cause its naturally unstable and youre putting yourself at risk. I'd bet most other "bad lucks" are likely similar in some fashion.

* Music is the primordial art form. It existed even before language did, long before humanity itself walked upon the earth.
