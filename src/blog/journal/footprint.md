Visiting the natural history museum, there's all sorts of exhibits, but one small one was most striking;
a pair of footprints in petrified mud. From some walk up a mountainside in the prehistory of mankind, the only evidence of the existence of an entire subspecies of pre-humanity.

What's the last and lasting imprint you or I will have upon the earth? 
What will be our final mark upon the world?
Did we already make it? A single footprint in the muck, dry and solidified on some long-past day's walk we don't even remember, in a place we don't know the name of.
