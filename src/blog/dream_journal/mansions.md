A recurring dream.
<!-- excerpt -->


I stumbled through a massive dusty mansion, filled with knickknacks collected over the years. For a moment I was in a giant regal-feeling 'great hall' that felt almost out of there will be blood, then another moment I was in a giant room filled floor to ceiling with treasures scavenged from god-knows where, but clearly collected by my late grandfather.

In another I wandered around a large mansion in and out of doorways during some kind of family get together. Half the house was clearly sealed off-not meant to be part of the party, but I wandered through it anyway, looking at the odd objects laying on the walls, the stagnant rooms. Eventually I found myself on a massive two-floor patio outside wrapping around the length of the house, with a view of the upper treeline, and wandered back to the party.
