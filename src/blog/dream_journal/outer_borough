In a somewhat ruined outer borough (not wrecked, just slummy) I am wandering about. Its a colorful part of town, all criss-crossing walkways and enticing signage. At some point I get to a town square, it is twilight hours, so the sky is purple and orange. I look back at the main borough and, paying proper attention for the first time, I take stock of just how staggeringly tall the central radio antenna is. It juts out, above the clouds. Such that even from miles away you have to crane your neck painfully back in order to take in the full height. I decide it'd be worth taking a photo of it so I attempt a few with my phone camera, but they don't come out quite right.
