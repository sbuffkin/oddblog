<p>My dream journal. I try to update this rather often. </p>

<p>These are all dated according to when I actually had the dream, so it's probably worth looking around in here. I mostly post things from my archives after polishing it up a little.</p>
<p> That said, it's only ever for grammar and phrasing, I only ever include details I actually remember from the dreams.</p>

{% include "./_includes/components/articleList.njk" %}

{%- for pageEntry in pagination.pages %}
    <li class="page_list"><a href="{{ pagination.hrefs[ loop.index0 ] }}"{% if page.url == pagination.hrefs[ loop.index0 ] %} aria-current="page"{% endif %}>Page {{ loop.index }}</a></li>
{%- endfor %}
