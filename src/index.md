# hello
Here is where you'll find various notes, art, writings, and so on from myself.

I'll try and make note of any major changes here. 

I've added a few [sketchbooks](/sketchbook). Right now its a little threadbare, but I'll try and go through and write some thoughts on them later and add some more stuff. 

I've actually got quite a few dreams yet to post, but I haven't really gotten around to editing them. I haven't dreamt much I remember well lately.

I'd like to actually get something done this year, so hopefully I'll have a project to show off sooner or later. It doesn't do well to say things like that, but I'll at least keep it non-specific.

Everything on the website is my own.

If you would like to ask me about anything on here, or just to chat, feel free to [email me](mailto:dusty@oddduck.cc).

Here's my site button if you so desire. It links to my soon-to-be-populated link directory for now:
