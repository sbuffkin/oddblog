Attempting to go to sleep late in what seemed to be an empty parking lot outside a single story building on an island in my car.
As I recline and roll up the windows, a child begins to approach from the opposite side. He's a figure composed entirely of shadow. The creature shuffles quickly towards the car. I crank it up faster, fast as I can go.
He tries to reach inside through the last crack in my window.
I try to drive away and end up stuck on the other curb.
The once empty lot bursts into a cacophony of activity. Many are sleeping in their cars and begin looking around at the fool slamming into curbs in the latest hours of the night.
