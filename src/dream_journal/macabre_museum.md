A massive multilevel museum with macabre exhibits. It is comfortably dimly lit in the yellow-brown tones of ambient light reflecting off dark stained wood. The exhibits seem to glow from nowhere, but never brightly. They all provoke a uniformly bizarre reaction, but there is something compelling about them. It makes you hungry to go through them all.

There are alcove sections off the main route. I feel drawn in, and go into one that has suits of something. I sit down and stare at my phone, contemplating sending a letter filled with misery to someone I hate. An old man nearby senses that I look off somehow, and pats me on the shoulder and sits down next to me to talk about the woes of life.
