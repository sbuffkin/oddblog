Wandering the streets of megacity seoul. Bright, dazzling. A nighttime walk. We are headed to the new office. I spot kyrakios grizzly driving a taxi on the way and manage to snap a photo. He barely fits inside.

In the lobby of the skyscraper. It isn't particularly noteworthy, and there appears to only be one elevator shaft. A tiny elevator arrives and half the team clambers in. I make it to the entrance but don't fit. I gear up to wait quite a while as the office is on the 69th floor. But shortly after the doors close another elevator arrives. This one is massive, an entire room on an elevator. Its got a large wooden table, leather seats, desks. Its like a lobby, a meeting room, and an office all at once. But as it jerks to start it becomes very difficult to walk around, and so we just settle into place. There are windows that let in the lights and view from outside at regular intervals.

We get to the office. It still feels somewhat unfinished, but there are many things waiting for us. There is a christmas tree for some reason, as well as quite a few large carpet squares of astroturf. I wander around. There's a room with sofas that has a bunch of old pizza boxes sitting around from when we last checked in. I take a look at them to see if the pizza is still any good after having sat around for days. My friend, braver than I, chomps a slice and then claims two pizzas to take home. I test a pepperoni from one and even it feels quite off. I shrug and let him have at it.
