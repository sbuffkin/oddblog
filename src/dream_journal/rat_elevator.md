I was chasing a rat around my apartment. There were holes everywhere, so it darted in and out of sight easily. Soon, it climbed up the shelves nimbly. It darted through my foam-board office ceiling, up and away. I peered through my ceiling and saw a shaft, sparsely populated with thick cables as in an elevator, dangling and crisscrossing with delicate metalwork, going up and up and up into a dim blue-grey fog. The rat climbed up the nearest one and darted away.
