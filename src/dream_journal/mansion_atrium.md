At a giant mansion where I had to spend the night. I had meant to go hiking nearby but we ended up here instead. The entrance atrium was massive, like a hotel lobby, with a lowered area with several games. It was ornate, with many wood insets and well crafted wooden railings.
There was a lovely pool table but its edged up against the front wall, or perhaps a van parked out front. I scooch it out a little and begin setting it up but no one seems to want to play. I go and look at a group playing something else, one of whom is a nun, she says don't worry about it and just leave it there.
