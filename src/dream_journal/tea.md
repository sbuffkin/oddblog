A strange woman brewed a pool of some kind of thick yellow tea, upon which she splashed a brown tincture substance that she told me was vallium. She used a wooden ladle to scoop up a cups worth and handed me the ladle. I nervously drank, and felt my whole body relax. I asked if it would be an issue if I drank more. It was creamy and delicious. She shrugged. I drank.
