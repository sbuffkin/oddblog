Speeding and wobbing and weaving along a forested 2 lane highway around very slow moving traffic. A car cuts me off, infuriating. I tail the guy and he begins to spew smoke so I back off but someone asks what the hell im doing, get back in there. 
Theres a giant tree collapsed across one lane that comes out of nowhere, I narrowly dodge into the other lane without hitting anyone, still on the tail of the smoke-spewer.
