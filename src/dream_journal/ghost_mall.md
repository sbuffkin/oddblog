Wandering through a massive ghost mall.

There are many closed down or half functional stores.
A formerly bath and body store that seems to have been torn limb from limb, a few people remain, picking through the remnants and scraps.

A department store elegantly boarded up with moulded stained wood, like a casket for a whole building.

A store with a large glass front wall, peering into a dingy yellow-brown room.
At the back, a wooden wall akin to a hotel lobby, where people are keeping their keys. A massive hook wall. Clearly the store has seen better days, and seems functionally closed except for the small figure hunched over on a chair near the middle of the room. Yet there are still a scattering of keys up upon the 12 foot tall wall of small hooks.
