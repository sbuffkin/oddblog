My apartment was much larger. It had a cavernous warehouse-esque area I didn't tend to venture into. This was because it was haunted. The whole place was haunted, but the shadowy abandoned area where mysterious crates were stacked high was especially haunted.
I was shown a video of our place, or perhaps a sister apartment that looked similar. It was much emptier. The video was still, until a blurry mass began marching from the darkness at the right side of the screen. I was not a fan. Ghosts felt similar to other pests and critters to me, an infestation. 

I was told the best solution was to hang up some crucifixes. So I resolved to get to a catholic shop soon. I wondered how my irreligious friends would feel, and went into my friend's bathroom where a half dozen crosses were hung, tiny ones over the toilet, one in the shower. If it was like this elsewhere.. I got the sense that if they were doing this without issue it was probably fine. This place certainly didn't seem haunted.
