We were laying down on a ridge in a car stripped down to the axels. We had blankets and so on to make it more comfortable.
It was night and several people were illegally camping below us and causing a ruckus. We knew it was only a matter of time before the patrols looked our way and were preparing for that, even though we were very comfortable and tired.

We started packing just as a cop showed up, a chubby woman. She saw us packing and decided to leave us be. We got almost everything into our now intact car, and rolled off. We rolled into someone's driveway to finish packing. It turned out to be nathan fielder's. He came out and was frustrated at first, but it seemed we were early and moving quick enough that he did not mind. He asked us if we wanted him to cook us any food, we said sure. We gave him some of our meat to cook. He came back with three plates. Mine had toast but no meat on it.
