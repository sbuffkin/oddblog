A bathhouse in the wilderness. The stairs were shewn down into the ground a few steps, and the whole place seemed to be constructed of one slab of solid grey stone.  It was as though you walked into a manmade cavern. There were stone shower stalls with handsome wooden doors, but also wood slats for benches inset upon carved stone. Steady embers of fire were going in pits placed strategically around the facility, keeping things pleasantly warm. There were stone lids that served to catch the heat of the embers, which I placed a breakfast into to heat up. Channels of warm water coming from below the fires lead to several sauna booths in a hallway to the back of the bathhouse.
