A botanical garden set in walkways thru a canopy
Many of the exhibits are in pots and such, somehow begging to be plucked. And thus, many of them have been picked over by the passersby. My group has indulged in this quite a bit. I grab some sort of multi layered mushroom, a large conical object which wobbles despite being a mountainous thing.
