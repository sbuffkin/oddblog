On a video call with a girl I fancied. 
She was hiding her face behind a graphic that moved to cover it. It was a sort of flat, iconographic mask. Not like any tribal mask I've seen, but circular and gave the impression of priestess. Geometric and angular.

We sat and talked and chatted a while. She decided to sing to me. I caught a glimpse of her reflection as she set up, she was very pretty. She sang, and it was beautiful, but many of my friends began arriving, busting into my house one after another blathering on. I tried my best to ignore them and enjoy the beautiful song.
