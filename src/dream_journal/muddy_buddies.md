I had made a huge batch of "muddy buddies" which are basically a sort of chex snack. I had made enough to fill several tall cookie tins full of em. 
My brother had apparently taken a look at this cereal stashed away in the sunroom and filled each tin up with milk.
I was furiously eating all of the soon-to-be ruined cereal and complaining to everyone within earshot.
Someone tried it and told me that it wasn't very good, which made me even more frustrated. I said it was probably because all of the cocoa got washed off by the milk. I ate and ate.
Soon enough I got to the bottom of the huge tin. It felt like an ignomious accomplishment.
