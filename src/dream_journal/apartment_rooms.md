I had many visitors at my new apartment.
Some were in the kitchen, some were in the stairwell.
Gradually we found that there were doors, previously blocked, that would open.
Each door opened into a new room which everyone claimed was part of my place, but it was obvious that they were recently abandoned apartments of their own.
Some had fridges covered in magnets and tables still set for several people. Nevertheless we went on about our visit. All rooms were red hardwood flooring and half paneling, white walls. Old and cracked but lit by orange yellow light that felt sourceless.
