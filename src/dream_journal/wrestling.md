I was in a wrestling battle royale. Several people from high school, work, and otherwise were there. I was going around getting some shots in on people but overall just trying to stay alive. 

A girl had her spirit broken because she had to take out a friend of hers. I fought her in that classic wrestling way where you both grasp hands above you and just push the other into submission. As I finished her off, I told her I'd go far against the others after winning to make her look better. 

I then stalked around the ring flipping out the high level competition, the strongest guys in the scruff. I'd get in quick underneath them and jump up to flip them out of the ring. Ultimately, I didn't win, but I was able to claim that I beat all the best wrestlers.
