A roadside farmhouse. Large, reddish wood barn. I'm chatting with the person running the place. Mom wanted to go here. She's a bit anxious and it's bothering me secondhand. I start looking at the asparagus. It is an appealing green-blue. The store runner tells me that sadly they're gonna have to close soon, they got bought out or something. I start packing a box of the asparagus out of sympathy, some desire to help out in a small way, but some water gets in. For some reason a straw is in there too. I go to dump out the water and the store runner snaps at me harshly HEY YOU IDIOT. Apparently it is very bad to pour out water through a straw due to some chemical or other and I should have known better. I take the straw out, the place is much more crowded than I remembered, people milling about looking at things, even though it seemed to have barely any stock in. I drain the box and go to leave. I realize I forgot to pay for it and sheepishly go back to do so, the store runner gives me a snide grimace.
