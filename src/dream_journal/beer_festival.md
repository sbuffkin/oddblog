Preparing for a trip with dad and my brother. It's going to be a long one. Had to pack a lot of stuff and was endlessly nitpicked. I recall a grabbing a telescoping coffee cup made of silicon.  It didn't hold much and the telescoping seemed pointless. I took too long to get ready. The plan was to hit ihop for breakfast and keep going onwards to the shore.

Beer festival, representatives from all the beer brewers are here, all dressed as pirates. I'm sampling at the various food court style stands. Eventually, on a stage of several large wooden tier-step-seats, I get cornered  by a dozen brewers and asked what I like. I list off the brewers I actually like to the crowd and most scoff and leave. I try to explain my reasoning to the dogfish head guy but he's not super interested either.

I go, and come across a girl sitting at a bar whos talking about her key-charm necklace. Sometimes it opens things just fine and she's on a roll, sometimes it jams and she knows its gonna be a bitch of a day.
