I was in a hilly, foggy forested park. Walking along, playing that game where you try and keep your balance on the curb. 
Whilst doing this I was texting a friend who was exploring the undercity of seattle. Apparently there were vast, bottomless pits if you went deep enough under the tallest buildings.
He told me he was on the hunt for mole people. He wanted to find them and talk to them.
At this point I think I saw a mole person appear on my walk, and then a loud rattling sound suddenly stirred me awake. I looked around to make sure there weren't any mole people in my apartment, but it was probably just birds on the fire escape. All the same, I couldn't get back to sleep after..
