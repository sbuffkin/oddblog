Catching a plane. I forget my shoes. but the airline provides complimentary super puffy shoes.
I go all the way to the back of a massive jet liner. The flight isnt quite smooth.
We land down in miami. We ride down the runway extremely fast till near the end when we lay on the brakes, its a long, tense moment.
I check the boarding pass which tells me to go talk to a polish girl and get a sausage first thing before I can get directions to the next gate. I think I am going to miss my flight to nyc.
