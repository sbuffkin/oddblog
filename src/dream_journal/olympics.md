I was on an unimportant role in the men's ice skating team in the winter Olympics. For this, they had found me a small, cold shack in the middle of a beach town owned by a couple. I sat in the drafty shack and requested a snack. I received a sort of goo. 
I laid down on the fold out bed. The woman joined me and tried to seduce me. I refused.

When it came time to leave, I went off along the boardwalk, a long and narrow icy thing. I took note of all the strange stores I passed along the way. All open despite it being as offseason as it gets. Most were odd things like general stores or key cutters. There were many people sitting on the short beach as well. All in beachwear despite the icy waters. It seemed to be a college town.

I made my way to the Olympic center. I managed to convince security I belonged and got in. I went to my assigned room, which seemed to overhang the arena I was competing in. I was late. The event was at 3 and I got there just before 1. I watched some guy do a "quick stop" event where you would go up as high as you could on a steep 90 degree ramp and then come to a stop as soon as you could. It seemed like a carnival game.

I had to find door number 200. I went out and down an intertwined, criss-crossing set of stairs made of steel tubes in an outdoor area. I made my way back in. Here was the "village" a set of stalls all over the place. All seemed to be selling wares while people milled about. Most didn't look athletic, more like families. I asked a woman where 200 was, she laughed at me and pointed behind me, and asked for 30 bucks. I laughed it off. 
I went, and while the hallway signs kept saying 200, I never actually saw the door, it was 211, 206, 203. It seemed I was getting closer. Finally, I found 200. It opened up into a cafeteria, people milled about listlessly inside.
