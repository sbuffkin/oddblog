I am moving into a high rise at the same time as my friend. His mom is with him. We enter an elevator, and I immediately feel something is amiss. I hit 10, he hits 23. We zoom past ten without stopping and they assure me that this probably was just a minor mishap, maybe it thinks we are meant to get it on the way back down. We get closer and closer to 23, and we get there and the doors open as we approach the landing. Except we oscillate, bouncing up to 25 and down to 21, the landing of 23 tantalizing us as the bounces shrink in size. Almost stable; the elevator goes into a deadfall. We drop down the shaft before slamming into the ground.
