Had a conversation with a girl I wasn't interested in about something disgusting for what felt like hours.

In a bookstore near the design shelf talking to some fella. He told me his girlfriend made one of the books on the other side of the shelf. "Her uncle had an in with a publisher " was the answer when I asked if it was any good. I said that that doesn't mean much when it comes to books like those, though the books on the shelf facing us were truly dire. They seemed to be about high-end design techniques such as covering blank walls in a few random cutout shapes and string.
