At night, pitch dark all around except for the eerie electric blue light emanating from the water. This large deep pool that had big buttons that caused loads of different things to appear in it as holograms. One at a time, like they were effects in a game. One was a remote control nighthawk jetplane that slowly rotated in the water. It showed off all sorts of gadgetry as it turned. 
Another hologram, a set of massive swirling chains of flowers, a blue one was the head of the chain. A series of red blooms followed it like a massive underwater flower snake. The blue flowers almost flapped in a nonexistent breeze as the snakes swam through the water back and forth.
