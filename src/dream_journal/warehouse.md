The earliest dream that I can recall. From long ago in childhood.
<!-- excerpt -->

The sprawling, damp, grey backrooms of a warehouse complex. There is a hallway leading to a dark place. 
A wide doorless archway leads to a bright room with an opaque but see-through ceiling. Though it is still a part of the stained, run-down warehouse complex. The walls are made of a grey-brown smooth stone. The lights are dim.
There is a crowd of nondescript toys including a toy phone, alive and going about their business. I feel that they all talked to me about something.
