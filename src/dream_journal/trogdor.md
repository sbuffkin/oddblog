I was chilling with some friends in a waterfront apartment in a city that was half-sunk into the ocean. We heard that apparently a giant monster named "trogdor" would be attacking soon. For whatever reason this didn't really cause panic so much as mild interest in getting to see such an event. Eventually he showed up, and we watched him rampage through the half-sunk buildings from afar. It was strangely comfortable standing out on the balcony trying to get a good eye on him attempting to knock buildings over.
